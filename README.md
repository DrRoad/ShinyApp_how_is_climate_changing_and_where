# ShinyApp_how_is_climate_changing_and_where



Even if global temperature has risen, the magnitude varies from region to region. Here, I use R to investigate how temperature has changed in the last 110 years. The data is from the Climatic Research Unit and you can download it from <a href="https://crudata.uea.ac.uk/cru/data/hrg/cru_ts_3.23/cruts.1506241137.v3.23//">here</a>.

I have deployed the app to Rstudio (click <a href="https://fishdata.shinyapps.io/final/">here</a>) and you can play with it to see how tempreature has been increasing in the last 100 plus years. You can double click over any region of interest (land part only, not oceans) on the map and you will get the trend of annual average temperature for the selected region. More than 95% of climate scientists agree that global warming is happening and we are the cause. See it for yourself on the link below. The data is from the Climatic Research Unit.
